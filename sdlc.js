// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "Figuring out what it is your software will need to be able to do and how much work it will likely take."
const design = "Putting plans and ideas for on paper to begin actually creating a blueprint for the planned project"
const implementation = "Beginning the actual coding process. Using prior designing and planning to creat early versions of your project."
const testingAndIntegration = "Running tests and refining your project so that it can be used and tested."
const maintain = "Updating and refining your project after it's initial usable version is available."
